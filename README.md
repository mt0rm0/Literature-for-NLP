Collected works in different languages for NLP projects

This is a small collection of works from different authors in different languages for using in NLP Projects.

The texts have no copyright, but they are intended for non commercial use, and research purposes.

The texts come, unless said otherwise, from the Project Gutemberg website, that has been making an extraordinary
effort collecting, scanning and cleaning an incrdibly huge amount of books, so they are available for everyone.
